This is the facade pattern that should create an Homecinema experience 
by printing all steps needed to start the experience by the click of a button 
The print is going to be on the console.


The primary goal of the facade pattern is to provide a higher-level interface that simplifies and abstracts
the interactions with a subsystem or a group of related classes.
By doing so, it shields the clients from the complexities and intricacies of the underlying system.
Clients can interact with the facade object without needing to understand the inner workings of the subsystem.
Overall the Facade Pattern makes the code more maintainable and allows interaction with multiple classes through an interface
which simplifies it and makes code more readeable.
